This is a library of algorithms and data structures. 
Its main goal is to provide data structures optimized for large scale graphs.

The main building block is a graph structure, called Packed Memory Graph, that combines a forward star graph structure and packed-memory arrays.

To test the library, you can try the example that is provided. 
The library requires the Boost C++ libraries to be installed.
Make sure you fill in the correct paths in the provided Makefile.
